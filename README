# Installation

You should be able to install prcs2hg by using the included 'setup.py' script
as typical Python package.

# Third-party components

The file 'prcs/sexpdata.py' was copied from the sexpdata package
<https://github.com/tkf/sexpdata> and modified not to parse numbers so that we
can handle PRCS version numbers correctly.
